## RFID-TEA-COLLECTING-AND-SUPPLIER-COORDINATION-SYSTEM

Based on this project, primarly we can validate the tea farmers tea supply in Kilograms, secondly quality. Here this system implements to validate weightage and tea quality and data has been feeding by some agent from the tea factory and it will be uploaded at the same location via mobile phone. These features leads to the stability and accuracy of this tea collecting system. and leads to keep good connectivity between tea farmers and the tea factory.

The image depicts a system designed to manage the supply chain of tea leaves, from the farmer to the processing facility. First of all, Collecting Agent visit to the estate and collect the tea leaves. In this point Collecting Agent upload tea weigh via mobile application. Once Collecting Agent deliver this tea leaves to tea factory, Verify Agent can log into application via mobile phone and verify tea weightage. All these process can monitor by Manager.  Here the key components and their roles.

### Farmer/Tea Supplier: 
The starting point. Farmers or tea suppliers provide the raw tea leaves.

### Collecting Agent: 
These agents are responsible for collecting the tea leaves from the farmers.

### Collecting and Coordination System: 
This seems to be a central hub where data about tea leaf collection, quality, and quantity is stored and managed. It likely facilitates communication between different stakeholders.

### Verifying Agent: 
These agents are responsible for verifying the quality and quantity of the collected tea leaves before they are sent for processing.

### Supply Tea Leaves to Process: 
This step represents the actual transportation of the verified tea leaves to the processing facility.

### Supporter: 
This role could represent various entities involved in the processing, packaging, or distribution of the tea.

### System Administrator: 
Manages and maintains the collecting and coordination system.
